<h1 align="center">Ivory Container Suite</h1>

## General

The Ivory Container Suite provides Docker containers that enable rapid deployment of IvorySQL, including administration and monitoring tools. Multiple styles of deploying IvorySQL clusters are supported.

If you are interested in contributing, please read the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

Complete build and install documentation is found [here](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/crunchy-containers/latest/installation-guide/).  The provided Dockerfiles build the containers on a Ubi 8 base image and use the community PostgreSQL RPMs.

Ivory provides a commercially supported version of these containers built upon RHEL 7 and the Ivory supported IvorySQL.
