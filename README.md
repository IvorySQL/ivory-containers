## Getting Started

Complete build and install documentation is found [here](https://access.Ivorydata.com/documentation/Ivory-containers/latest/installation-guide/).  The provided Dockerfiles build the containers on a Ubi 8 base image and use the community PostgreSQL RPMs.

Ivory provides a commercially supported version of these containers built upon RHEL 7 and the Ivory supported PostgreSQL. Contact Ivory for more details at:

Further descriptions of each of these containers and environment variables that can be used to tune them can be found in the [Container Specifications](https://access.Ivorydata.com/documentation/Ivory-containers/latest/container-specifications/) document.

## Usage

Various examples are provided in the [Examples](https://access.Ivorydata.com/documentation/Ivory-containers/latest/examples/) documentation for running in Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift environments.

You will need to set up your environment as per the [Installation](https://access.Ivorydata.com/documentation/Ivory-containers/latest/installation-guide/) documentation in order to execute the examples.
